## Purposes of Our Game

Our target audiences are mainly for primary and secondary school children to have an positve game to enjoy, but it is also suitable for any age of user to play our game. For the development, we chose the Agile Development Process. The reason for this choice is because the game market is highly competitive and we would like to adopt the Time-To-Market strategy. The Agile Development Process is a good fit for our strategy. We have concluded that we're able to complete this goal under some deep thinking of condition such as possibility, difficulty, work time period etc.
