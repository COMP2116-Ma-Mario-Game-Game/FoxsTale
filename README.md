## Schedule

Below is the planned schedule of the game development up to the first release. It is divided into three phases:

- Exploration (Feb 20 - Mar 11, 2025 / 3 weeks)

    In this phrase, we brainstormed the theme and the potential features of our game. Additionally, we built a simple demo to showcase the feasiblity.

- Iterations (Mar 24 - Apr 13, 2025 / 3 weeks)

    In this phase, the development process formally started. We carried out our development with weekly iterations.

- Pre-release (Apr 14 - Apr 20, 2025 / 1 week)

    In this phase, we had the game ready for its first release and hosted it in the PythonAnywhere platform. Besdies, we finalized the front page of our repository.
