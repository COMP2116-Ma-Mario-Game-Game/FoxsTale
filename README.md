## Purposes of Our Game

Our target audiences are mainly for primary and secondary school children to have an positve game to enjoy, but it is also suitable for any age of user to play our game. For the development, we chose the Agile Development Process. The reason for this choice is because we have concluded that we're able to complete this goal under some deep thinking of condition such as possibility, difficulty, work time period etc.

## Schedule

Below is the planned schedule of the game development up to the first release. It is divided into three phases:

- Exploration (Feb 20 - Mar 11, 2025 / 3 weeks)

    In this phrase, we brainstormed the theme and the potential features of our game. Additionally, we built a simple demo to showcase the feasiblity.

- Iterations (Mar 24 - Apr 13, 2025 / 3 weeks)

    In this phase, the development process formally started. We carried out our development with weekly iterations.

- Pre-release (Apr 14 - Apr 20, 2025 / 1 week)

    In this phase, we had the game ready for its first release and hosted it in the PythonAnywhere platform. Besdies, we finalized the front page of our repository.

## Development Process

Recording of meetings
Members: p2321060 Bibie, P2304318 Todd, P2321902 Thomas, P2304152 Micheal, P2304111 Henry Chou

Meeting 1  Date : 20th February,2025  12:15pm-1:30pm at classroom
Conclusion: Today we learnt the ability of each member  and have decided that Micheal, Todd and Bibie would mainly deal with program related tasks, at the same time, Thomas and Henry  would mainly deal with documentation .The reason why we emphasize “mainly” is because no matter what a member is tasked, we will have some work related to both sides, so nobody will do only programming or documentation. This is the working model of our team. 

Moreover, we have made sure that every member has a GitHub account. And we have settled two dates of deadline for checking the process of our project. 
Deadline : 11th March,2025 for finishing  basic structure of project, 31st  March2025 for finishing all documentation and programming. However, the distribution and deadline of the video remains TBD  until later process and discussion.
The next meeting date is arranged on 24th February, 2025 , we have planned to talk  further about the project’s details regarding the software  process model and the subject of the project.

Date:21st February,2025
We was discussing the group name of GitHub file suddenly via group chat on Discord.At last , we left it on Monday meeting. 

Meeting 2 Date:24th February,2025 1:04pm-3:06pm
Conclusion: At the beginning, we discussed two main problems, what’s the topic of the project and if we should use database technology. We discussed about various types of topic to predict the difficulty and possibilities. Moreover, we also had an important discussion about the usage of technologies such as SQL, Jason, Ajax , framework, JavaScript, html, adobe animate, game engine, Unity … etc. We brainstormed many ideas such as a database system of school library, a competition between two AI playing Chess, building a game website with database, etc. After an excruciating discussion, we finally got an answer. We have decided that we would use Unity to create a Mario mini game using open source assets and put it on a website. It will feature a scoreboard ranking using Django. 
Meanwhile, we built our organization on GitHub called “COMP2116 Ma Mario Game Game”. We divided the processes of creating the game into two parts, which are ranking and the main game. Michael will do the ranking website while Thomas, Todd and Bibie work on the game. Further details of the game like time limit, objects, characters etc will be discussed on a later date.

The next meeting will be after we are done with the prototype.

3 rd meeting : 3rd April,2025
Due to the process exceeding our predicted deadline while the midterm tests are killing us. We concluded what we have done and the future roadmap. We discussed about the connection and functionality between GitHub and Unity. Furthermore, we have applied a new strategy after analyzing the benchmark of the project. Next, we figured out what we should do next such as increasing the game’s playing time and focus to deal with document. However, there is a another problem. The score system we had discussed before wasn’t complete yet, so we will try to finish it by the deadline or worst case we will use the timing as the score. At last, we arranged the new deadline for completing the fundamental content of document before 11th April, finishing the demo by 6th April and running the demo for testing and developing the document process by 14th April.

## Future Plan

This section outlines the elements of our game that how it might be developed in future:
1.More levels: the difficulty will increase as player enter to the next level.
2.Game tutorial: insert a beginner tutorial at the very first stage to teach player hoe to play.
3.Multi-player system: except the solo mode, it could be developed a multi-players mode for new game experience.
4.Different character: new character could be invented whuch might bring with variety extra ability.
5.New character's skin: character's skin system might be developed in order to improve attract of player on the game.
6.Shopping system: A shopping system could be develpoed to let player to spend the coins they have got in the game and buy new character, skin or item if any.
7.Invent item: item may give character different effect.
