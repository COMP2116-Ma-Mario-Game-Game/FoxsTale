## Schedule

Below is the planned schedule of the game development up to the first release. It is divided into three phases:

- Exploration (Feb 20 - Mar 11, 2025 / 3 weeks)

    In this phrase, we brainstormed the theme and the potential features of our game. Additionally, we built a simple demo to showcase the feasiblity.
